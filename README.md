<p>This repository contains the final project for the Programming 3 Lab, an interactive game called "Guess the Movie". The main goal is to challenge players to identify movies based on images, enhancing their visual recognition and memory through fun gameplay. The game reads a list of movies from a structured text file, organizes them into five distinct categories, and presents movie-related images for players to guess the correct title. The project was developed using Java and focuses on applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and file handling techniques.</p>

<h1 align="center">Objective</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Apply <b>OOP fundamentals:</b> encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.</li>
  <li>Develop an <b>interactive game</b> with a responsive GUI.</li>
  <li>Learn how to <b>read and organize data from structured text files.</b></li>
  <li>Implement game logic, response validation, and visual feedback for the player.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h1 align="center">Main Features</h1>
<ul>
  <li><b>Five Movie Categories:</b> Movies are grouped into five categories, each with its own challenge set.</li>
  <li><b>File-Based Data Loading:</b> The list of movies is read from a .txt file with clearly structured categories.</li>
  <li><b>Image-Based Gameplay:</b> Players guess the movie based on a related image shown in the GUI.</li>
  <li><b>Array Management:</b> Arrays are used to store and manipulate movie data, ensuring efficient access and control.</li>
  <li><b>Answer Validation:</b> Checks the player's input against the correct answer and provides feedback.</li>
  <li><b>Engaging and Educational:</b> Combines entertainment with cognitive challenge.</li>
</ul>

<h1 align="center">How to Use</h1>

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jordanmedinaortiz/guess-the-movie-java.git
   cd guess-the-movie-java
  
2. Prepare the resources
   <ul>
     <li>Ensure the /images folder contains the image files related to each movie.</li>
     <li>Make sure the movies.txt file is properly formatted and included.</li>
   </ul>

3. Compile the project
   <p>Use your preferred IDE (like IntelliJ or NetBeans) or compile manually:</p>
   
   ```sh
   javac -cp "lib/*" -d bin src/*.java

4. Run the application
  <p>Ensure all dependencies (libraries and database) are correctly linked:</p>
   
    ```sh
    java -cp "bin:lib/*" Main

5. Gameplay Instructions
   <ul>
     <li>Select a movie category from the menu.</li>
     <li>Look at the displayed image.</li>
     <li>Select the movie name and submit your guess.</li>
     <li>Get feedback instantly and move on to the next challenge!</li>
   </ul>

<p>This project was developed as the final deliverable for the Programming 3 Lab. It combines technical depth with a fun user experience, demonstrating proficiency in OOP, file handling, and interactive Java GUI development.</p>
